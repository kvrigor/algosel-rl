\begin{abstract}
A set of hard computational problems can be solved more efficiently when using multiple algorithms instead of a single algorithm. This technique is called algorithm selection. An algorithm selection model captures the relationship between problem features and algorithm performance, using this knowledge to assign the best-performing algorithms to problems. Most approaches in literature use supervised learning techniques to learn the problem featureâ€“algorithm performance relationship. This study presents a different perspective by training algorithm selection models using reinforcement learning---an experience-driven learning approach inspired by how humans and animals naturally learn from their environment. REINFORCE, the proposed reinforcement learning algorithm, is compared with pairwise random forest regression, a supervised learning algorithm from a previously related study. Experiment results show that an algorithm selection model trained using REINFORCE performs poorly as compared to one trained using pairwise random forest regression. However, zooming into the results reveal that REINFORCE did better than pairwise random forest regression on solving the easier problems, which constitutes the majority of the dataset. Still, REINFORCE fails because it is not able to perform well on solving the much harder problems on the dataset, which have a huge impact on the final calculation of algorithm selection performance scores. Nevertheless, this study maintains hope on the potential of reinforcement learning in producing algorithm selection models with better performance than models trained using supervised learning techniques.
